A word changing extension for firefox

## Project idea

We were thinking of a text changing extension that had multiple different options for different text-changing applications. Some of the things we had in mind were using a caesar cipher to encrypt/decrypt web pages, changing every instance of the word I in the webpage to "me" to make things silly, changing every link in the webpage to point to a given destination (such as the homepage for our extension). We were thinking of trying to do this via a more extensible architecture where we allow the user to specify rules to change the original webpage into a new webpage and the things we suggested are examples that we pre-provide, but we're not entirely sure whether this will be feasible.
